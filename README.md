# DogCatClassifierUsingVGG16
<b>VGG16 – Convolutional Network for Classification and Detection</b>

VGG16 is a convolutional neural network model proposed by K. Simonyan and A. Zisserman from the University of Oxford in the paper “Very Deep Convolutional Networks for Large-Scale Image Recognition”. The model achieves 92.7% top-5 test accuracy in ImageNet, which is a dataset of over 14 million images belonging to 1000 classes. It was one of the famous model submitted to ILSVRC-2014. It makes the improvement over AlexNet by replacing large kernel-sized filters (11 and 5 in the first and second convolutional layer, respectively) with multiple 3×3 kernel-sized filters one after another. VGG16 was trained for weeks and was using NVIDIA Titan Black GPU’s.


<b> About </b>

In this competition, you'll write an algorithm to classify whether images contain either a dog or a cat.  This is easy for humans, dogs, and cats. Your computer will find it a bit more difficult.

<b> Data </b>

The training archive contains 25,000 images of dogs and cats. Train your algorithm on these files and predict the labels.

<b> Target </b>

To predict if the given image is a dog or a cat.
